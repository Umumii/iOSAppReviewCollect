### Guideline 2.1 - Performance - App Completeness


Your app or its metadata does not appear to include final content. Specifically, your app contained placeholder contents in 公告 in 首页.

Before you submit your app to the App Store, all of its content and metadata must be final. Your app must not include placeholder or incomplete information. For example, an app with “lorem ipsum” text in the app description field will be rejected. Likewise, an app with placeholder screenshots, such as “screenshot coming soon,” will be rejected. Instead, you should only submit an app with complete information and content throughout.


### Guideline 2.2 - Performance - Beta Testing


Your app contains references to test, trial, demo, beta, pre-release or other incomplete content.

Specifically, the screenshots contained 测试.



### Guideline 2.3.3 - Performance - Accurate Metadata


We noticed that your screenshots do not sufficiently reflect your app in use.

Specifically, your 12.9-inch iPad Pro (3rd Generation) screenshots do not display the app in the correct device frame.

### Guideline 2.1 - Information Needed


We have started your app's review, but we were unable to successfully access all or part of your app. 

In order for us to continue the review, you will still need to provide a functional demo account that gives us access to all parts of your app so that we may fully review its content, features, and functionality. If all or part of your app is restricted, you will still need to provide a whitelisted demo account that gives us access to your app. Note that providing a demo video showing your app in use is not enough for us to continue the review.

Specifically, please kindly provide a Chinese mobile phone number and its SMS verification code since we have no Chinese mobile phone number and could not call you at the time of review.
